    Justice Delayed, Justice Denied: Time for Change
  </h1>
 <body><h5> India's justice system is failing its victims, particularly in cases of sexual assault and rape. The lack of accountability and inefficiencies in the system have led to widespread disillusionment and fear among those seeking justice ¹.

Victims often face significant barriers, including humiliation at police stations and hospitals, unwillingness to register complaints, inadequate protection, and degrading medical examinations ¹. The absence of a witness protection law leaves victims vulnerable to pressure and intimidation, undermining prosecutions ¹.
</h5><p>
<h3>*Challenges in Filing Complaints*
</h3>
- Police reluctance to register complaints, especially for marginalized communities
- Lack of effective legal assistance for victims
- Inadequate medical and counseling services
</p><h3>
*Perpetuating Injustice*
</h3><p>
- Judges' bias and insensitive language in courtrooms
- Prosecutors hiding information to favor the accused
- Corruption and bribery influencing judgments
</p><h3>
  <h4>
    Law Commission of India by the Thirty Nineth report 1968 Max Punishment is 14 Years.
In india Victims are in Jail or punished for more than 14 years and Accuses are freely moving out of jail and enjoying well
  </h4>
*A Call to Action*
</h3> <p>
To address these issues, India needs systemic reforms, including:

- Effective implementation of existing laws
- Increased funding for victim support services
- Sensitization and training for police, judges, and medical professionals
- Witness protection laws to ensure victim safety


The government must prioritize justice and support for victims, ensuring that their rights are protected and perpetrators are held accountable ¹ ². Only then can India move towards a fairer and more compassionate society.

   <h3>First Judge asks the victim and accuse to know the case in short sentence due to time management and in a few times case hearings judge will know who is victim and who is accuse by talying the past statements.
Then cross examine the both prosecutors by multiple questions using his knowledge and experience. Here no need to question the victim or accuse.
However First give a security to the victim physically and financially for he came next hearing else injustice will grow..
