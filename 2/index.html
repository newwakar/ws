 <body><h5> India's justice system is failing its victims, particularly in cases of sexual assault and rape. The lack of accountability and inefficiencies in the system have led to widespread disillusionment and fear among those seeking justice ¹.

Victims often face significant barriers, including humiliation at police stations and hospitals, unwillingness to register complaints, inadequate protection, and degrading medical examinations ¹. The absence of a witness protection law leaves victims vulnerable to pressure and intimidation, undermining prosecutions ¹.

<h3>*Challenges in Filing Complaints*
</h3>
- Police reluctance to register complaints, especially for marginalized communities
- Lack of effective legal assistance for victims
- Inadequate medical and counseling services
</p><h3>
*Perpetuating Injustice*
</h3><p>
- Judges' bias and insensitive language in courtrooms
- Prosecutors hiding information to favor the accused
- Corruption and bribery influencing judgments
</p><h3>
*A Call to Action*
</h3> <p>
To address these issues, India needs systemic reforms, including:

- Effective implementation of existing laws
- Increased funding for victim support services
- Sensitization and training for police, judges, and medical professionals
- Witness protection laws to ensure victim safety


The government must prioritize justice and support for victims, ensuring that their rights are protected and perpetrators are held accountable ¹ ². Only then can India move towards a fairer and more compassionate society.
